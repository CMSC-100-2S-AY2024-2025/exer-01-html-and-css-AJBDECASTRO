                I take great pride in my creative skills and passion for turning abstract ideas into meaningful projects. Whether it's designing, crafting, or exploring new forms of art, I enjoy using my imagination to create something original and impactful. I thrive on brainstorming innovative solutions and thinking outside the box, often combining artistic vision with strategic problem-solving. This ability to generate fresh ideas fuels both my academic pursuits and personal interests, allowing me to express myself in ways that go beyond conventional methods.

                One of my strengths is my ability to multitask effectively, handling various responsibilities simultaneously while maintaining a strong focus on each task. I’ve developed this skill by consistently managing academic workloads, extracurricular activities, and personal projects all at once. Balancing multiple priorities has helped me cultivate better time management, adaptability, and decision-making skills. Whether facing tight deadlines or sudden changes in plans, I remain organized and capable of meeting expectations without compromising the quality of my work.

            <p>Hi! I am Andrei Josh B. De Castro, but you can call me AJ for short. I am currently studying at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. I graduated from UST Senior High School and Rosario Institute. I enjoy watching movies, bingeing series, and playing games during my free time.

            Since I was little, I dreamt of studying at UPLB, becoming an "Iskolar ng Bayan" was a goal I held close to my heart. I didn't start with a passion for coding, but my love for solving challenging math problems led me to pursue Computer Science. Over time, I began to appreciate how programming brings creative solutions to logical problems, blending structure and imagination.
            
            Being in UPLB has taught me more than just academics; it’s where I've learned the importance of resilience, collaboration, and embracing new challenges. I look forward to honing my skills further in programming and problem-solving while making meaningful contributions to both my university and future career.
            
            Through every challenge and triumph, I continue to chase my dreams with the same passion that brought me here.</p>
