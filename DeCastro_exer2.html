            <p>Hi! I am Andrei Josh B. De Castro, but you can call me AJ for short. I am currently studying at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. I graduated from UST Senior High School and Rosario Institute. I enjoy watching movies, bingeing series, and playing games during my free time.

            Since I was little, I dreamt of studying at UPLB, becoming an "Iskolar ng Bayan" was a goal I held close to my heart. I didn't start with a passion for coding, but my love for solving challenging math problems led me to pursue Computer Science. Over time, I began to appreciate how programming brings creative solutions to logical problems, blending structure and imagination.
            
            Being in UPLB has taught me more than just academics; it’s where I've learned the importance of resilience, collaboration, and embracing new challenges. I look forward to honing my skills further in programming and problem-solving while making meaningful contributions to both my university and future career.
            
            Through every challenge and triumph, I continue to chase my dreams with the same passion that brought me here.</p>
